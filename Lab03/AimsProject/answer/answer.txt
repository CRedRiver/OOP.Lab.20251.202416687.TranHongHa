Question: Is Java a pass-by-value or a pass-by reference programming language?
- Java is a pass-by-value language. As tested with the TestingParameter Class, when a method
is called with parameter value, the parameter is copied and then the copy is changed, which 
means the original variable pointing to the object is still untouched.

Question: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), why do the titles 
of these two objects still remain?
- Because when we call swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), the values in the parameter part
are copied so we basically just swap those copies, not original, hence the output is 
still the same.

Question: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why 
is the title of the jungleDVD changed?
- Because when dvd.setTitle(title) is called, it directly modifies the actual objectâ€™s 
field (the title).
